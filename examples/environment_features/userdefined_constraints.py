'''
This code example presents how the constraint monitor can be used to define custom termination conditions.
This feature is interesting for e.g. three-phase drives, where the current needs to be monitored with
respect to the total current within all three phases , and not separately per phase.
In this example we will define an external constraint for the DcSeriesMotor which lies at 95 % of
the predefined current limit.

For a more general introduction to GEM, we recommend to have a look at the "_control.py" examples first.
